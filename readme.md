# Seattle Maps

This repo contains geoJSON and pdf files for the city of Seattle (Seattle proper only) in the following resolutions:

1. Whole city
2. PUMAs
3. CROs
4. Neighborhoods
5. Census Tracts

These maps are based on the 2016 census tract data and the PUMA geocoding matching done by Mike Famulare and [found here](https://github.com/seattleflu/simulated-data). Thanks Mike!
