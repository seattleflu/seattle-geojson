# Seattle Maps

This repo contains geoJSON and pdf files for the city of Seattle (Seattle proper only) in the following resolutions:

1. Whole city
2. CROs
3. Neighborhoods
4. Census Tracts

These maps are based on the 2016 census tract data and the PUMA geocoding matching done by Mike Famulare and [found here](https://github.com/seattleflu/simulated-data). Thanks Mike!
